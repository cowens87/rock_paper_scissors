# ## Iteration 3
# You have been contracted by the University of Denver to write a program that can track terms. Specifically, they would like you to implement the following functionality:
# 1. Each term has a name, like "Winter 2018" as well as a way to read that data
# 1. Each term has a list of multiple courses
# 1. A term can list all courses that are open. A course is open if it has fewer students than its capacity.
# 1. A term can list all student names across all courses.
# Build upon your code from the first two iterations to complete this task.
