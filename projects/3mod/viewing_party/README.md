## Design Strategy
The design strategy of Viewing Party was to fully encapsulate each piece of functionality of the program and minimally store data, while avoiding API consumption limits:

### Users Table
- The Users Table represents all registered users for the viewing party application. Users are represented in the application as the current user and can also be represented as a friend of another registered user.

### Friends Table
- The Friends Table represents registered users who have been designated by another registered user as a friend.

### Parties Table
- The Parties Table stores information about parties created by users.

### Parties Users Table
- The Parties Users Table links a party to a specific user.
### Movies Table
- The Movies Table stores information about a movie and a movie can have many parties.
