# Rails Engine - An E-Commerce API

  <h3 align="center">Rails Engine</h3>

  <p align="left">
    Rails Engine is an API developed for an E-Commerce Application. The fictitious company utilizes a service-oriented architecture, and therefore utilizes this API as a separate back-end service. This repo exposes the data that powers the company's site through a RESTful JSON API in addition to custom endpoints for Business Intelligence Analytics.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Rails Engine exposes business data based on the [JSON API Specification](https://jsonapi.org) via multiple API endpoints allowing other developers access to CRUD functionality for Merchants and Items, obtaining relationship information for Merchants and Items, and exposes more complex endpoints including: merchants with the most revenue, merchants with the most items sold, revenue across a date range, and revenue for a specific merchant.

### Endpoints

#### Index of Resource

This endpoint renders a JSON representation of all records of the requested resource.

`GET /api/v1/<resource>` where `<resource>` is `merchants` or `items`


#### Show Record

This endpoint renders a JSON representation of the corresponding record.

`GET /api/v1/<resource>/:id` where `<resource>` is `merchants` or `items`

#### Create Record

This endpoint creates a record and renders a JSON representation of the new record.

`POST /api/v1/<resource>` where `<resource>` is `merchants` or `items`

#### Update Record

This endpoint updates the corresponding record and renders a JSON representation of the updated record.

`PATCH /api/v1/<resource>/:id` where `<resource>` is `merchants` or `items`

#### Find Many Resources By Attribute
This endpoint returns all records that match a set of criteria. Criteria will be input through query parameters.

`GET /api/v1/<resource>/find_all?<attribute>=<value>`

#### Merchants with Most Revenue

This endpoint returns a variable number of merchants ranked by total revenue.

`GET /api/v1/merchants/most_revenue?quantity=x` where x is the number of merchants to be returned.

#### Merchants with Most Items Sold

This endpoint returns a variable number of merchants ranked by total number of items sold:

`GET /api/v1/merchants/most_items?quantity=x` where x is the number of merchants to be returned.
